# Stock Market Prediction with LightGBM

Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction project using LightGBM! This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for predicting stock prices based on historical data. By leveraging the power of LightGBM, advanced data preprocessing techniques, and feature engineering, we've created a highly accurate prediction model.

## Overview

In this project, we use historical stock market data to train a LightGBM regression model. The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, outlier detection, and creating essential indicators such as spread, mid-price, and Relative Strength Index (RSI). The model is then trained on this preprocessed data to predict future stock prices.

## Key Features

- Utilizes LightGBM, a powerful gradient boosting framework, for regression tasks.
- Implements advanced data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values and outlier detection.
- Generates key indicators such as spread, mid-price, and RSI for feature engineering.
- Visualizes correlations and feature importances to gain insights into stock price movements.
